# Welcome to responsive-data

The basic idea of this library is to change a data to be responsive on change.
There are many ideas where this is useful and it will be shown step by step when the
library has all required functionality I'm looking for.

For now have a look at the menu on the left where you can find what is already done
or follow the links after here:

  - [The Subject / Observer Pattern](subject-observer.md) ([example usage](notebooks/subject-observer.ipynb))
  - [Responsive Data Handling](responsive-data-handling.md) ([example usage](notebooks/responsive-data.ipynb))
